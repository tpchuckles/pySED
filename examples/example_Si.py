# 2. monatomic basis "unwraps" the folded brillioun zone! (a long wavelength wave (low k) affecting every-other-atom (bs argument specify those atom IDs) may exactly mathematically satisfy the same motion as a short wavelength wave (high k) affecting every atom. this is where optic branches come from!)
