This is just a basic set of python functions for running Spectral Energy Density analysis to obtain a phonon dispersion. Phonon linewidths indicate scattering rates, so if you're feeling fancy, you can fit a lorentzian to the linewidths and get scattering rates. 

extra functions are included: a dump file reader using ovito's python tools, a position averager (with wrapping for periodic boundary conditions), etc

i also included an example script showing how to use the SED function, and example outputs. example script relies on https://github.com/ExSiTE-Lab/niceplot
